Stable Marriage Problem has exponential time complexity,
likely O(3^N) due to iterative exploration of matchings

the space complexity is linear, O(1), mainly due to the array storing matchings,
the number of pairs (3 in this case).

 Explanation :
 Time complexity appears exponential due to the algorithm's approach to generating
 and checking all possible matchings for stability.
 Specifically, for each man, the algorithm iterates over all potential matches

 Space  determined by the storage requirements for the arrays used in the algorithm. The q[3] array stores the current matching being evaluated,
 and the mp[3][3] and wp[3][3] arrays store the static preference matrices for men and women.
 These arrays have fixed sizes that do not scale with the input size; they are determined by the problem's parameters (3 men and 3 women).
 Therefore, the space complexity is considered constant, O(1)
